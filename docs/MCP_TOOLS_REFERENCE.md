## Integration Examples

### Basic IDE Integration

```typescript
// Configure TINAA MCP in your IDE
const tinaa = new MCPClient("tinaa", {
  command: "python",
  args: ["/path/to/tinaa/app/tinaa_mcp_server.py"]
});

// Start a collaborative session
const session = await tinaa.call("start_collaborative_session", {
  project_name: "My Web App Tests",
  target_url: "https://myapp.com"
});

// Get workspace status
const status = await tinaa.call("get_workspace_status");
console.log(`Total projects: ${status.total_projects}`);
```

### Advanced Collaborative Workflow

```typescript
// 1. Start collaborative session
const session = await tinaa.call("start_collaborative_session", {
  project_name: "E-commerce Testing Suite",
  project_description: "Comprehensive testing for online store",
  target_url: "https://shop.example.com"
});

// 2. Answer discovery questions
const requirements = await tinaa.call("answer_discovery_questions", {
  session_id: session.session_id,
  answers: {
    app_purpose: "E-commerce platform with user accounts",
    user_journeys: "Browse, search, cart, checkout, account management",
    browser_support: "Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile browsers",
    auth_methods: "Email/password, social login, guest checkout",
    success_criteria: "Zero critical bugs, <2s page loads"
  }
});

// 3. Refine scenarios based on IDE analysis
const refined = await tinaa.call("refine_test_scenarios", {
  session_id: session.session_id,
  scenario_feedback: {
    checkout_test: "Add payment method validation",
    mobile_test: "Include responsive design checks"
  },
  additional_requirements: "Must support international shipping"
});

// 4. Generate executable playbook
const playbook = await tinaa.call("create_comprehensive_playbook", {
  session_id: session.session_id,
  playbook_preferences: {
    automation_level: "high",
    test_types: ["functional", "accessibility", "performance"],
    reporting: "detailed"
  }
});

// 5. Create project from playbook
console.log(`Playbook created with ${playbook.playbook.steps.length} steps`);
```

## Error Handling

All TINAA MCP tools follow consistent error handling patterns:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await tinaa.call("create_project", {
    project_name: "My Tests",
    template: "basic-web-testing"
  });
  
  if (!result.success) {
    console.error(`Project creation failed: ${result.error}`);
    return;
  }
  
  console.log(`Project created: ${result.project_id}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`MCP tool error: ${error.message}`);
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Session Management
- Always check session status before continuing collaborative workflows
- Store session IDs for multi-step processes
- Handle session timeouts gracefully

### 2. Error Recovery
- Validate inputs before calling tools
- Implement retry logic for network-dependent operations
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Use `get_workspace_status` to check system health before intensive operations
- Monitor storage usage for large projects
- Cache repository information when possible

### 4. Security
- Never expose API keys or credentials in tool parameters
- Use secure authentication methods for Git operations
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
