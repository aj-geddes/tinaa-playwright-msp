- Node.js 18+ or Docker
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 2GB free disk space
- Internet connection for AI features

### Can I use TINAA offline?

Basic features work offline, but AI-powered test generation requires internet connectivity.

### How do I upgrade TINAA?

```bash
# Pre-built Docker image
docker pull ghcr.io/aj-geddes/tinaa-playwright-msp:latest
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Build from source
git pull origin main
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Where can I find pre-built Docker images?

Pre-built images are available on GitHub Container Registry:

See the [Docker Image Guide](../DOCKER_IMAGE.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Test Execution

### How accurate are AI-generated tests?

TINAA provides intelligent test insights and recommendations to help you create more effective tests. The AI analyzes your application to suggest test scenarios, identify edge cases, and recommend best practices. While TINAA doesn't automatically generate tests, its insights help developers write more comprehensive and reliable test suites.

### Can I customize generated tests?

TINAA helps you execute and manage your Playwright tests efficiently. Since you write your own tests with TINAA's guidance, you have complete control over test implementation. TINAA provides recommendations and insights that you can incorporate into your test development process.

### What types of tests can TINAA execute?

- Functional tests
- End-to-end tests
- Regression tests
- Accessibility tests
- Performance tests
- Visual regression tests

## Troubleshooting

### Why are my tests failing?

Common causes:
1. Application changes (use self-healing feature)
2. Network issues
3. Timing problems (adjust timeouts)
4. Environment differences

### How do I debug test failures?

```bash
# Run with debug mode
tinaa run --debug

# Generate trace files
tinaa run --trace
```

## What if AI generation produces incorrect tests?

1. Improve your prompts with more specific instructions
2. Provide example tests for better context
3. Use the feedback feature to improve AI accuracy
