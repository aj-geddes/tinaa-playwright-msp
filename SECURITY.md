# Security Policy and Scanning Guide

## üîí Security Overview

TINAA implements multiple layers of security to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. This document outlines our security practices and how to use the security scanning tools.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Pre-Push Security Hook
A Git pre-push hook automatically runs security checks before allowing code to be pushed to the repository:
- Scans for hardcoded secrets and API keys
- Checks deployment files for exposed credentials
- Validates file permissions
- Runs static security analysis

### Security Scanning Tools

#### 1. Quick Security Scan
Run a comprehensive security scan:
```bash
./scripts/security-scan.sh
```

This checks for:
- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Python security issues (via bandit)
- Insecure file permissions
- Docker security best practices
- Kubernetes security configurations
- Git history for accidentally committed secrets

#### 2. Manual Security Checks

**Secret Detection:**
```bash
# Install detect-secrets
pip install detect-secrets

# Scan entire repository
detect-secrets scan --all-files

# Scan specific directory
detect-secrets scan app/
```

**Python Security Analysis:**
```bash
# Install bandit
pip install bandit

# Run security analysis
bandit -r app/ -f json -o security-report.json

# View high severity issues only
bandit -r app/ -ll
```

**Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
```bash
# Install pip-audit
pip install pip-audit

# Check for vulnerable packages
pip-audit

# Get detailed descriptions
pip-audit --desc
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Commit Secrets
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Store secrets in Kubernetes secrets or HashiCorp Vault
- Use placeholders like `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in examples

### 2. Secure Configuration
- All sensitive configuration should use environment variables
- Use `.env` files locally (never commit them)
- In production, use Kubernetes secrets or cloud secret managers

### 3. File Permissions
- Scripts should have permissions 755 or more restrictive
- Configuration files should be 644 or more restrictive
- Never use 777 permissions

### 4. Docker Security
- Always specify a non-root USER in Dockerfiles
- Use specific version tags, not `:latest`
- Minimize image layers and remove unnecessary packages
- Scan images with tools like Trivy or Snyk

### 5. Kubernetes Security
- Define SecurityContext for all pods
- Set resource limits and requests
- Use NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic
- Enable RBAC and use least privilege principles
- Regularly rotate secrets

## üö® Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to the maintainers
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

## üìã Security Checklist

Before pushing code:

- [ ] Run `./scripts/security-scan.sh`
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] All secrets use environment variables
- [ ] File permissions are appropriate
- [ ] No vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Docker image follows security best practices
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests include security contexts
- [ ] Code passes static security analysis

## üîÑ Regular Security Maintenance

### Weekly
- Run dependency vulnerability scans
- Review security alerts from GitHub

### Monthly
- Update dependencies to latest secure versions
- Review and rotate API keys and secrets
- Audit file permissions

### Quarterly
- Full security audit
- Review security policies and update as needed
- Security training for team members

## üõ†Ô∏è Bypass Security Checks (Emergency Only)

In rare cases where you need to bypass security checks:

```bash
# Bypass pre-push hook (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git push --no-verify

# Skip specific detect-secrets check
# Add to .secrets.baseline after review
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Only bypass security checks after thorough review and with team approval.
